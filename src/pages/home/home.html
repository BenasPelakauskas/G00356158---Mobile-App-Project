        <p>Mullagh, in irish: An Mullach, is a small town located in County Cavan 4KM away from the Meath Border.
          As of 2016 it has a population of 1348 people.<br>
          The town has a heritage centre dedicated to St Kilian, who was born in Mullagh 
          c 640 and was martyred in WÃ¼rzburg in Franconia in northern Bavaria, Germany, in circa 689.<br><br>
          The environs of the village have witnessed substantial housing and industrial development in recent years.<br>
           Mullagh's relative proximity to the new M3 motorway 
          has had the effect of making the capital city more accessible to Mullagh and County Cavan.
